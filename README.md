# Hold_Predictor
- This is a work in progress to build a Student Hold Predictor.
- While accuracy is decent, as of now, the recall score is very low and that is the most important measure since we want to attempt to successfully predict a hold.
- Decision Tree appears to be the most successful as of now.
